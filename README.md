<h1>Homework for CS510: Mastery in Programming</h1>

Some interesting projects. 
<ul>
<li>Wrote a program to solve sudoku efficiently. Gets all solutions, not just one solution. </li>
<li>(Need to test sudoku on boards with lots of solutions to see how fast it is. </li>
<li>Strongly-connected component program using Tarjan's Algorithm. Kind of cool since I had only used Kosaraju's Algorithm. </li>
<li>Eight queens is kinda trivial, but kinda fun. </li>
<li>Buffed up my C skills, etc. </li>
</ul>
